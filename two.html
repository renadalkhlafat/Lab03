Another difference between the optimist and the pessimist is that the optimist sees difficulties as a singular event, while the pessimist sees them as universal.

This means that when things go wrong for the optimist, he or she looks at the event as an isolated incident largely disconnected from other things that are going on in their life.

A pessimist will take the incident and add it to a laundry list of other things going on in their life. They have a largely negative outlook on everything and tend to expand the stress they feel towards one issue, onto other, unrelated areas of their life.

So, to remain positive, try to remind yourself that just because you are facing a setback in one area – whether that be a project at work falling behind or not hitting a milestone set – does not mean that the entire goal is obsolete. You may simply need to modify your plan.

A single setback may seem big at the moment, but in reality, you can quickly overcome most setbacks with the right outlook. Isolating the incident allows you to take the setback in stride and then move on from it.</p></em>
