An individual who is truly an optimist has the ability to be both objective and unemotional when caught up in the inevitable storms of daily life. This person has the ability to continue talking to themself in a positive and optimistic way no matter what is happening in their life.

This allows them to keep their mind calm, clear, and completely under control despite the external circumstances. As this individual is more relaxed and aware, they are much more capable of interpreting events more efficiently.

So, when an optimist is met with a challenge or area of stress, they are much better equipped to overcome it. They are able to stay in complete control, act proactively, and not let external forces cloud their judgment.

On the other hand, a pessimist may get caught up in their emotions, leading them to get angry, upset, and distracted. This leads to them handling problems poorly, thinking irrationally, and making things harder than they really have to be by acting reactively instead of proactively.

If you feel overwhelmed or like your blood is boiling, practice being calm in these situations. Although easier said than done, staying calm and thinking positively can change your life.
